# Welcome!

I will be posting stuff that you can use for your own games here! The things I'll post here include:

* Code for [p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org) (**_I'm still learning_**);

* Project bases for Contruct 2 (you can also use on [Construct 3](https://editor.construct.net)).

If you use any of my stuff, make sure to credit me!

## Introduction
I am just a 15 year old indie developer who enjoys making games. I began uploading my games back in 2019, on Gamejolt. I won't be uploading source code of my games, as I don't like sharing them.

I don't just use Construct 2 and p5.js, though. I also use ```GDevelop``` for making games, and I make FNF mods, using the [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine) "Mods" folder.

## Where can I find your games?
If you wish to see and play my available games, you can find them on [```Gamejolt```](https://gamejolt.com/@UnyieldingHeartGames_Official) and on [```Itch.io```](https://unyieldingheart-games.itch.io).

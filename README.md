## Welcome!

I will be posting stuff that you can use for your own games here! There will not be source code from my games, as I don't like to share them.
The things I'll post here include:

* Code for [p5.js](p5Guide.md) (**_I'm still learning_**);
* Project bases for Contruct 2 (you can also use on 3).

If you use any of my stuff, make sure to credit me!
